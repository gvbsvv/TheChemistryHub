# AP Chemistry - Atomic Structure and Properties (Expanded)

## Introduction

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter. Understanding their structure and properties is crucial for comprehending chemical behavior. This section covers the essential concepts of atomic structure and properties relevant to AP Chemistry, aligning with commonly taught material in US colleges.

## Subatomic Particles

Atoms consist of three primary subatomic particles:

| Particle | Charge | Mass (amu) | Location        |
|----------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Proton   | +1     | ~1         | Nucleus         |
| Neutron  | 0      | ~1         | Nucleus         |
| Electron | -1     | ~0         | Electron Cloud  |

*   **Protons:** Positively charged particles found in the nucleus. The number of protons determines the element's identity (atomic number, Z).
*   **Neutrons:** Neutral (uncharged) particles also located in the nucleus. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. The sum of protons and neutrons is the mass number (A).
*   **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles that occupy the space surrounding the nucleus. They are much lighter than protons and neutrons. Electrons are responsible for chemical bonding and interactions.

## Atomic Number, Mass Number, and Isotopes

*   **Atomic Number (Z):** The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It defines the element. All atoms of a given element have the same atomic number.
*   **Mass Number (A):** The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. A = Z + N (where N is the number of neutrons).  The mass number is specific to a particular isotope of an element.
*   **Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element (same Z) but with different numbers of neutrons (different A). Isotopes have the same chemical properties (because they have the same number of protons and electrons) but may have different nuclear properties (e.g., radioactivity).  Isotopes are often represented using the notation:  ¬π‚Å¥C, ¬π¬≤C (where 14 and 12 are the mass numbers).  The average atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses of its isotopes.

## Electron Configuration and Orbitals

Electrons are arranged in specific energy levels and sublevels within the electron cloud. These arrangements are described by electron configurations.

*   **Energy Levels (n):** Principal energy levels, n = 1, 2, 3, etc. Higher values of n correspond to higher energy levels and greater average distances from the nucleus.
*   **Sublevels (l):** Within each energy level, there are sublevels designated as s, p, d, and f. Each sublevel has a specific shape and can hold a maximum number of electrons:
    *   s: 2 electrons (1 orbital)
    *   p: 6 electrons (3 orbitals)
    *   d: 10 electrons (5 orbitals)
    *   f: 14 electrons (7 orbitals)
*   **Orbitals:** Regions of space within a sublevel where there is a high probability of finding an electron. Each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Pauli Exclusion Principle). Orbitals have distinct shapes (spherical for s orbitals, dumbbell-shaped for p orbitals, etc.).

**Rules for Electron Configuration:**

*   **Aufbau Principle:** Electrons fill orbitals starting with the lowest energy level and sublevel.  A helpful way to remember the filling order is using the diagonal rule.
*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. This means each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, and these electrons must have opposite spins.
*   **Hund's Rule:** For degenerate orbitals (orbitals with the same energy), electrons will individually occupy each orbital before doubling up in any one orbital. This minimizes electron-electron repulsion.

**Example Electron Configurations:**

*   Oxygen (O, Z = 8): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p‚Å¥
*   Iron (Fe, Z = 26): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p‚Å∂ 3s¬≤ 3p‚Å∂ 4s¬≤ 3d‚Å∂
*   Chromium (Cr, Z=24): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p‚Å∂ 3s¬≤ 3p‚Å∂ 4s¬π 3d‚Åµ (Note: Exceptions to the filling order occur to increase stability of half-filled and fully filled d sublevels)

## Periodic Trends

The periodic table organizes elements based on their electron configurations, leading to recurring trends in their properties.

*   **Atomic Radius:** The size of an atom.
    *   **Trend:** Increases down a group (due to added energy levels), decreases across a period (due to increasing nuclear charge pulling electrons closer).
*   **Ionization Energy:** The energy required to remove an electron from an atom in its gaseous state.
    *   **Trend:** Decreases down a group (outer electrons are further from the nucleus and easier to remove), increases across a period (stronger nuclear attraction makes it harder to remove electrons).
*   **Electronegativity:** The ability of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond.
    *   **Trend:** Generally decreases down a group, increases across a period (similar to ionization energy). Fluorine is the most electronegative element.
*   **Metallic Character:** Tendency of an element to exhibit metallic properties (e.g., conductivity, malleability, ductility).
    *   **Trend:** Increases down a group, decreases across a period.

## Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Orbitals

*   **Quantum Numbers:** A set of four numbers that describe the properties of an electron in an atom:
    *   Principal Quantum Number (n): Energy level (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)
    *   Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l): Sublevel shape (l = 0 for s, 1 for p, 2 for d, 3 for f).  l can have values from 0 to n-1.
    *   Magnetic Quantum Number (ml): Orientation of the orbital in space (ml = -l to +l, including 0).  This describes the specific orbital within a sublevel.
    *   Spin Quantum Number (ms): Spin of the electron (+1/2 or -1/2).
*   **Atomic Orbitals:** Mathematical functions that describe the probability of finding an electron in a specific region of space. They have characteristic shapes (spherical for s orbitals, dumbbell-shaped for p orbitals, etc.).  The shapes of the orbitals are related to the angular momentum quantum number (l).

## Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES)

PES is an experimental technique used to determine the ionization energies of electrons in an atom. It provides evidence for the shell model of the atom and helps determine electron configurations.  PES spectra plot the number of electrons ejected versus the ionization energy.  Each peak in the spectrum corresponds to the ionization of electrons from a specific sublevel.  The position of the peak tells you the ionization energy, and the area under the peak is proportional to the number of electrons in that sublevel.

##  Effective Nuclear Charge (Zeff)

The effective nuclear charge is the net positive charge experienced by an electron in an atom.  It is less than the actual nuclear charge (Z) due to shielding by inner electrons.

*   **Trend:**  Zeff increases across a period (due to increasing nuclear charge) and is relatively constant down a group (shielding by inner electrons is more effective).
*   **Importance:** Zeff affects various atomic properties, including atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity.

##  Paramagnetism and Diamagnetism

*   **Paramagnetic:**  Substances with unpaired electrons are attracted to a magnetic field.
*   **Diamagnetic:** Substances with all paired electrons are slightly repelled by a magnetic field.

The presence of unpaired electrons in an atom or ion makes it paramagnetic.  Knowing the electron configuration allows you to predict whether a species will be paramagnetic or diamagnetic.
