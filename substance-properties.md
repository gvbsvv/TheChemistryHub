# AP Chemistry - Properties of Substances and Mixtures

## Introduction
Substances and mixtures exhibit different physical and chemical properties based on their composition.

## Types of Matter
1. **Pure Substances**
   - Elements (e.g., Oxygen, Gold)
   - Compounds (e.g., Water, Sodium Chloride)
2. **Mixtures**
   - Homogeneous (e.g., Air, Saltwater)
   - Heterogeneous (e.g., Sand and Water, Salad)

## Physical vs. Chemical Properties
- **Physical Properties**: Density, Color, Melting Point
- **Chemical Properties**: Reactivity, Flammability, Acidity

## Separation Techniques for Mixtures
- **Filtration**: Separates solids from liquids.
- **Distillation**: Separates based on boiling points.
- **Chromatography**: Separates based on polarity differences.
