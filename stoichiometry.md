# Stoichiometry

## What is Stoichiometry?
Stoichiometry is the study of **quantitative relationships** in chemical reactions.

## The Mole Concept
- **1 mole = 6.022 × 10²³ particles** (Avogadro’s number).
- Moles relate atomic mass to measurable quantities.

## Balancing Chemical Equations
- **Law of Conservation of Mass**: Matter cannot be created or destroyed in a reaction.
- Example:  
  \[
  2H_2 + O_2 → 2H_2O
  \]

## Stoichiometric Calculations
- **Mole-to-Mole Conversions**
- **Mass-to-Mole Conversions**
- **Limiting and Excess Reactants**
- **Theoretical and Percent Yield**
