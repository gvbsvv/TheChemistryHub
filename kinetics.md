# AP Chemistry - Kinetics

## Introduction
Kinetics studies the speed of chemical reactions and the factors that affect reaction rates.

## Factors Affecting Reaction Rate
1. **Concentration** - Higher reactant concentration increases collisions.  
2. **Temperature** - Higher temperature increases kinetic energy, leading to more collisions.  
3. **Surface Area** - Greater surface area leads to more effective collisions.  
4. **Catalysts** - Lower activation energy and speed up reactions.  
5. **Nature of Reactants** - Ionic compounds react faster than covalent compounds.

## Rate Laws
- Expressed as **Rate = k[A]ⁿ[B]ᵐ**
- **Order of reaction**: Determined experimentally.

## Activation Energy and Catalysts
- **Activation Energy (Ea)**: The minimum energy required for a reaction.  
- **Catalysts**: Provide an alternate pathway with lower Ea.
