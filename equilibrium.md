# AP Chemistry - Chemical Equilibrium

## Introduction
Equilibrium occurs when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, resulting in constant concentrations.

## Equilibrium Constant (K)
- **K = [Products]ⁿ / [Reactants]ᵐ**
- **K > 1** → Products favored  
- **K < 1** → Reactants favored  

## Le Chatelier’s Principle
A system at equilibrium will shift to counteract disturbances:
- **Adding Reactants** → Shifts right (produces more products).
- **Removing Products** → Shifts right.
- **Increasing Temperature**:
  - Exothermic → Shifts left.
  - Endothermic → Shifts right.
- **Pressure Changes**: Affects gases; shifts towards fewer moles.
