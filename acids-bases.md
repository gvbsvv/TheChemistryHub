# AP Chemistry - Acids and Bases

## Introduction
Acids and bases play a crucial role in chemistry, affecting pH, reactivity, and equilibrium.
Acid-Base chemistry is a fundamental topic in chemistry that deals with the interaction between acids and bases. It is crucial for understanding various chemical reactions, biological processes, and industrial applications.

## Definitions
1. **Arrhenius Definition**:
   - Acids release H‚Å∫ in water.
   - Bases release OH‚Åª in water.

2. **Bronsted-Lowry Definition**:
   - Acids donate protons (H‚Å∫).
   - Bases accept protons.

3. **Lewis Definition**:
   - Acids accept electron pairs.
   - Bases donate electron pairs.

## pH and pOH
- **pH = -log[H‚Å∫]**
- **pOH = -log[OH‚Åª]**
- **pH + pOH = 14**

## Strong vs. Weak Acids/Bases
- **Strong Acids**: HCl, HNO‚ÇÉ, H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ
- **Weak Acids**: CH‚ÇÉCOOH
- **Strong Bases**: NaOH, KOH
- **Weak Bases**: NH‚ÇÉ
