# AP Chemistry - Thermodynamics and Electrochemistry

## Thermodynamics
### Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG)
- **ΔG = ΔH - TΔS**
- **ΔG < 0** → Spontaneous reaction
- **ΔG > 0** → Non-spontaneous reaction

### Entropy (ΔS)
- Measure of disorder.
- **ΔS > 0** → More disorder (favorable).

## Electrochemistry
### Redox Reactions
- **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons.
- **Reduction**: Gain of electrons.
- **Oxidizing Agent**: Causes oxidation.
- **Reducing Agent**: Causes reduction.

### Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells
- **Spontaneous redox reaction** produces electrical energy.
- **Anode**: Oxidation occurs (negative).
- **Cathode**: Reduction occurs (positive).

### Electrolytic Cells
- **Non-spontaneous reaction** driven by electricity.
- Used in **electroplating** and **water splitting**.
