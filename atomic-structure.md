# AP Chemistry - Atomic Structure and Properties (Comprehensive)

## I. Atomic Structure

### A. Introduction

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter. Understanding their structure is the foundation for comprehending chemical behavior.

### B. Subatomic Particles

Atoms consist of three primary subatomic particles:

| Particle | Charge | Mass (amu) | Location        |
|----------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Proton   | +1     | ~1         | Nucleus         |
| Neutron  | 0      | ~1         | Nucleus         |
| Electron | -1     | ~0         | Electron Cloud  |

*   **Protons:** Positively charged particles in the nucleus. The number of protons defines the element (atomic number, Z).
*   **Neutrons:** Neutral particles in the nucleus. Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
*   **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles in the space surrounding the nucleus. They are responsible for chemical bonding.

### C. Atomic Number, Mass Number, and Isotopes

*   **Atomic Number (Z):** Number of protons in the nucleus. Defines the element.
*   **Mass Number (A):** Total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. A = Z + N.
*   **Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element (same Z) but with different numbers of neutrons (different A).  They have the same chemical properties but may have different nuclear stabilities.  Represented as ¬π‚Å¥C, ¬π¬≤C, etc.

### D. Electron Configuration and Orbitals

Electrons are arranged in energy levels and sublevels.

*   **Energy Levels (n):** Principal energy levels (n = 1, 2, 3...). Higher n means higher energy and greater distance from the nucleus.
*   **Sublevels (l):** Within each energy level: s (2e‚Åª), p (6e‚Åª), d (10e‚Åª), f (14e‚Åª).
*   **Orbitals:** Regions of space where there's a high probability of finding an electron. Each orbital holds a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Pauli Exclusion Principle).

**Rules for Electron Configuration:**

*   **Aufbau Principle:** Electrons fill orbitals starting with the lowest energy.
*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers.
*   **Hund's Rule:** For degenerate orbitals, electrons occupy each orbital individually before pairing up.

**Example Configurations:**

*   O (Z=8): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p‚Å¥
*   Fe (Z=26): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p‚Å∂ 3s¬≤ 3p‚Å∂ 4s¬≤ 3d‚Å∂
*   Cr (Z=24): 1s¬≤ 2s¬≤ 2p‚Å∂ 3s¬≤ 3p‚Å∂ 4s¬π 3d‚Åµ (Exception for stability)

### E. Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Orbitals

*   **Quantum Numbers:**
    *   n: Principal quantum number (energy level)
    *   l: Angular momentum quantum number (sublevel shape, 0 to n-1)
    *   ml: Magnetic quantum number (orbital orientation, -l to +l)
    *   ms: Spin quantum number (+1/2 or -1/2)
*   **Atomic Orbitals:** Mathematical descriptions of electron probability; have characteristic shapes (s, p, d, f).

### F. Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES)

PES measures the ionization energies of electrons.  It provides evidence for the shell model and helps determine electron configurations.  Peaks in PES spectra correspond to electron ionization from specific sublevels.

## II. Atomic Properties

### A. Periodic Trends

*   **Atomic Radius:** Size of an atom. Increases down a group, decreases across a period.
*   **Ionization Energy:** Energy to remove an electron. Decreases down a group, increases across a period.
*   **Electronegativity:** Ability to attract electrons in a bond. Generally decreases down a group, increases across a period. Fluorine is the most electronegative.
*   **Metallic Character:** Tendency to exhibit metallic properties. Increases down a group, decreases across a period.

### B. Effective Nuclear Charge (Zeff)

The net positive charge experienced by an electron. Increases across a period, relatively constant down a group. Affects atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity.

### C. Paramagnetism and Diamagnetism

*   **Paramagnetic:** Substances with unpaired electrons; attracted to a magnetic field.
*   **Diamagnetic:** Substances with all paired electrons; slightly repelled by a magnetic field.

### D.  Trends and Explanations

It's crucial not just to memorize trends but also to understand the *reasons* behind them:

*   **Shielding:** Inner electrons shield outer electrons from the full nuclear charge.
*   **Nuclear Charge:**  The positive charge of the nucleus (due to protons).
*   **Electron-Electron Repulsion:** Repulsion between negatively charged electrons.
*   **Distance from the Nucleus:**  Electrons farther from the nucleus are less strongly attracted.

## III.  Connecting Structure and Properties

Atomic structure (electron configuration, quantum numbers, etc.) *directly determines* the properties of an atom.  Understanding the structure allows you to explain and predict trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, electronegativity, and other properties.  This connection is fundamental to chemistry.
