# Gas Laws

## The Three Main Gas Laws
1. **Boyle’s Law**  
   - At constant temperature:  
   \[
   P_1V_1 = P_2V_2
   \]
   - Example: Compressing a gas increases pressure.

2. **Charles’s Law**  
   - At constant pressure:  
   \[
   \frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
   \]
   - Example: Heating a balloon makes it expand.

3. **Gay-Lussac’s Law**  
   - At constant volume:  
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
   \]
   - Example: A sealed aerosol can explodes if heated.

## The Ideal Gas Law
\[
PV = nRT
\]
- **P** = Pressure (atm)
- **V** = Volume (L)
- **n** = Moles of gas
- **R** = Ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)
- **T** = Temperature (Kelvin)
