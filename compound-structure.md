# AP Chemistry - Compound Structure and Properties

## Introduction
Compounds are substances formed when two or more elements chemically bond together. Their structure determines their properties and reactivity.

## Types of Chemical Bonds
1. **Ionic Bonds** - Formed when electrons are transferred between atoms.
2. **Covalent Bonds** - Formed when electrons are shared between atoms.
3. **Metallic Bonds** - Found in metals, where electrons move freely.

## Molecular Geometry
- **Linear**: Example - CO₂  
- **Trigonal Planar**: Example - BF₃  
- **Tetrahedral**: Example - CH₄  

## Physical Properties
- **Melting and Boiling Points**
- **Solubility in Water**
- **Electrical Conductivity**
