# Solutions

## What is a Solution?
A **solution** is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.

## Components of a Solution
1. **Solvent** - The substance that dissolves the solute (e.g., water in saltwater).
2. **Solute** - The substance that is dissolved (e.g., salt in saltwater).

## Factors Affecting Solubility
- **Temperature**: Higher temperature increases solubility (for most solids).
- **Pressure**: Affects solubility of gases (higher pressure = more dissolved gas).
- **Polarity**: "Like dissolves like" (polar dissolves polar, nonpolar dissolves nonpolar).

## Concentration Measurements
- **Molarity (M)** = moles of solute / liters of solution.
- **Mass Percent** = (mass of solute / total mass of solution) Ã— 100.
