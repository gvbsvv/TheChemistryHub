# AP Chemistry - Thermochemistry

## Introduction
Thermochemistry focuses on heat transfer in chemical reactions.

## Enthalpy (Î”H)
- **Endothermic Reactions**: Absorb heat (Î”H > 0)
- **Exothermic Reactions**: Release heat (Î”H < 0)

## Heat Capacity and Specific Heat
- **q = mcÎ”T** (Heat = mass Ã— specific heat Ã— temperature change)
- Waterâ€™s specific heat = 4.18 J/gÂ°C

## Hessâ€™s Law
- The total enthalpy change is the sum of individual steps.

## Calorimetry
- Measures heat changes in a system using a calorimeter.
