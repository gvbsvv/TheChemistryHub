# AP Chemistry - Atomic Structure and Properties

## Introduction
Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Their structure consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

## Subatomic Particles
| Particle  | Charge | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Proton    | +1     | Nucleus  |
| Neutron   | 0      | Nucleus  |
| Electron  | -1     | Electron Cloud |

## Electron Configuration
- Electrons are arranged in energy levels.
- Follows **Aufbau Principle**, **Pauli Exclusion Principle**, and **Hundâ€™s Rule**.

## Periodic Trends
- **Atomic Radius**: Increases down a group, decreases across a period.
- **Ionization Energy**: Decreases down a group, increases across a period.
- **Electronegativity**: Follows similar trends as ionization energy.
