# Redox Reactions

## What are Redox Reactions?
Redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions involve the **transfer of electrons** between substances.

## Oxidation and Reduction
- **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons.
- **Reduction**: Gain of electrons.

## Example: Rust Formation
\[
4Fe + 3O_2 → 2Fe_2O_3
\]
- **Iron (Fe)** is oxidized.
- **Oxygen (O₂)** is reduced.

## Identifying Redox Reactions
1. **Oxidizing Agent** - Causes oxidation (it gets reduced).
2. **Reducing Agent** - Causes reduction (it gets oxidized).

## Redox Applications
- **Batteries**: Chemical energy converted to electrical energy.
- **Corrosion Prevention**: Coatings and sacrificial anodes.
- **Electrolysis**: Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.
